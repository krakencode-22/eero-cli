# Programmatic control of Eero mesh WiFi networks

**Eero has no official public API**, but a well-documented unofficial API powers all community libraries. The Go library **goeero** provides basic functionality, while Python's **eero-client** offers the most mature standalone implementation. For comprehensive control including device blocking, the **Home Assistant integration** provides the most complete feature set—all use the same reverse-engineered REST API at `api-user.e2ro.com`.

## Official API status: none for general use

Eero (owned by Amazon since 2019) does not offer a public API for developers. The company's official stance, confirmed in their community forums: "eero does not have a public API available."

A limited **EU Data Portability API** exists for GDPR compliance, but it requires signing an NDA, completing a security assessment, and is **read-only**—no device control capabilities. This option is impractical for most developers seeking programmatic network management.

The good news: the Eero mobile app uses a REST API that has been thoroughly reverse-engineered since 2016. This unofficial API provides full control capabilities and forms the foundation for all community libraries.

## The unofficial API architecture

All libraries communicate with `https://api-user.e2ro.com` using a consistent pattern. The API uses **cookie-based authentication** with a mobile API session token obtained through SMS or email verification. Amazon Login uses a separate web/account flow and should not be assumed to produce a token that works against the mobile API.

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/2.2/login` | POST | Initiates login, returns user_token |
| `/2.2/login/verify` | POST | Verifies OTP code, activates session |
| `/2.2/networks/{id}/devices` | GET | Lists all connected devices |
| `/2.2/networks/{id}/devices/{id}` | PUT | Modify device (block, pause) |
| `/2.2/networks/{id}/profiles` | GET/PUT | Manage family profiles |
| `/2.2/networks/{id}/guestnetwork` | GET/PUT | Guest network control |
| `/2.2/networks/{id}/reboot` | POST | Reboot the network |

The authentication flow requires two steps: POST a phone number or email to `/2.2/login`, receive a verification code via SMS/email, then POST that code to `/2.2/login/verify`. The resulting token persists indefinitely and should be stored locally. If you already have a valid mobile API token from another trusted source, this CLI can validate and store it with `eero-cli login import-token`.

## Go: goeero provides core functionality

**Repository**: https://github.com/ab623/goeero  
**Package**: `github.com/ab623/goeero/eero`  
**License**: GPL-3.0 | **Stars**: 5 | **Latest**: v1.0.0 (August 2023)

This is currently the **only Go library** for Eero control. Installation is straightforward:

```bash
go get github.com/ab623/goeero/eero
```

The library supports authentication, listing networks and devices, and basic account operations:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/ab623/goeero/eero"
)

func main() {
    // With existing token
    client := eero.New(userToken)
    
    // List all devices
    devices, err := client.Devices()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    
    for _, d := range devices {
        fmt.Printf("Device: %s | MAC: %s | IP: %s | Connected: %v\n",
            d.Nickname, d.Mac, d.IP, d.Connected)
    }
}
```

For initial authentication:

```go
// Step 1: Request verification code
loginData, _ := client.Login("+15551234567")

// Step 2: User enters code received via SMS/email
client.LoginVerify(loginData.UserToken, "123456")
```

The library includes a CLI tool for quick testing: `./eeroclient devices | jq` outputs device JSON.

**Limitation**: goeero doesn't implement device blocking or pausing directly. You'd need to extend it with PUT requests to the device endpoint using payload `{"blocked": true}` or `{"paused": true}`.

## Python: the most mature ecosystem

### PyPI package (recommended for new projects)

**Package**: `eero-client` | **Version**: 2.2.0 (August 2024)  
**PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/eero-client/

```bash
pip install eero-client
```

This modernized library uses Pydantic models and type hints:

```python
from eero import Eero, FileSessionStorage

session = FileSessionStorage("session.cookie")
client = Eero(session=session)

# Authentication (first time only)
if not client.is_authenticated:
    user_token = client.login("+15551234567")
    code = input("Enter verification code: ")
    client.login_verify(code, user_token)

# List connected devices
for device in client.devices:
    print(f"{device.nickname or device.hostname}: {device.ip} ({device.mac})")
    print(f"  Connected: {device.connected}, Paused: {device.paused}")

# View blocked devices
blocked = client.device_blacklist

# Network operations
client.reboot()                    # Reboot entire network
client.reboot_eero(id=eero_id)     # Reboot specific node
client.run_speedtest()             # Trigger speed test
```

Available properties: `account`, `devices`, `device_blacklist`, `eeros`, `guestnetwork`, `profiles`, `speedtest`, `networks`, `diagnostics`, `insights`, `routing`.

### Original library (343max/eero-client)

**GitHub**: https://github.com/343max/eero-client  
**Stars**: 179 | **License**: MIT

The foundational library that all others derive from. Simpler code, useful for learning the API:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/343max/eero-client.git
```

## JavaScript: eero-js-api

**GitHub**: https://github.com/bbernstein/eero-js-api  
**NPM**: `eero-js-api` or `eero-node`  
**Stars**: 13 | **License**: MIT

```bash
npm install eero-js-api
```

A direct port of the Python library with identical functionality. Stores session tokens in `/tmp`. Less actively maintained but functional.

## Home Assistant integration: most complete feature set

**GitHub**: https://github.com/schmittx/home-assistant-eero  
**Stars**: 170 | **Latest**: v1.8.1 (September 2025)

While designed for Home Assistant, this integration's source code serves as the **best API documentation available**—it implements features no standalone library offers:

- **Device blocking and pausing** (clients and profiles)
- **Content filters** per profile
- **Guest network** enable/disable with settings
- **App blocking** per profile (requires Eero Secure subscription)
- **Activity data** and bandwidth metrics (requires Eero Plus)
- **QR code generation** for network joining
- **Firmware update control**
- **Nightlight control** for Eero Beacon devices

For developers building Go or Python applications, examining this codebase reveals the complete API surface area for blocking devices:

```python
# Conceptual example based on HA integration patterns
# PUT /2.2/networks/{network_id}/devices/{device_id}
payload = {"paused": True}   # Pause internet access
payload = {"blocked": True}  # Block device entirely
```

Install via HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) by adding as a custom repository.

## Authentication implementation details

The critical insight: the device-management API expects the mobile API session cookie (`s=...`), not the `account.eero.com` browser session. eero's official support documentation says switching to Amazon Login makes prior eero login credentials invalid and cannot be undone without deleting/recreating the account. In local testing, the Amazon web flow authenticated successfully to `account.eero.com`, but that web session token was rejected by `api-user.e2ro.com` as `error.session.invalid`.

**Workarounds for Amazon users**: Prefer a current-account path to a valid mobile API token. If the legacy email/phone flow is blocked for that account, import a current-account mobile API token obtained through an authorized path with `eero-cli login import-token`. A separate reachable admin identity can demonstrate mobile API access, but should be treated as an explicit fallback rather than the primary Amazon Login solution. Do not paste Amazon cookies into the mobile token field; the CLI validates the token before saving it.

Session tokens persist indefinitely once verified. Store them in a file:

```python
# Python pattern for persistent sessions
class FileSessionStorage:
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.path = path
        try:
            with open(path, 'r') as f:
                self._token = f.read().strip()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            self._token = None
    
    @property
    def cookie(self):
        return self._token
    
    @cookie.setter
    def cookie(self, value):
        self._token = value
        with open(self.path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(value)
```

Required HTTP headers for all requests:
```
User-Agent: eero-ios/2.16.0 (iPhone8,1; iOS 11.3)
Cookie: s=[USER_TOKEN]
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Rate limits and restrictions

Eero hasn't published official rate limits, but community experience suggests:

- **Minimum polling interval**: 25 seconds (used by Home Assistant integration)
- **Account data caching**: 1 hour recommended
- **No reported bans** for normal usage patterns
- **Aggressive polling may trigger throttling** (unconfirmed)

**Terms of Service consideration**: Using the unofficial API technically violates Eero's ToS prohibition on reverse engineering. However, thousands of users have run these integrations since 2016 without enforcement action.

## C/C++ status

**No C/C++ library exists**. The API is straightforward REST/JSON, so creating one using libcurl would be feasible using the endpoint documentation above.

## Recommendations by use case

| Goal | Best Option |
|------|-------------|
| Go application with basic features | **goeero** (extend for blocking) |
| Python application | **pip install eero-client** |
| Full device blocking/pausing | Reference **Home Assistant integration** source |
| Learning the API | **343max/eero-client** (clean, readable) |
| Production Home Assistant | **schmittx/home-assistant-eero** via HACS |
| Prometheus monitoring | **brmurphy/eero-exporter** |

## Conclusion

The Eero ecosystem lacks official API support, but the community has built robust tooling around the reverse-engineered mobile app API. **For Go development**, goeero provides a foundation that you'd need to extend for blocking features. **For Python**, the PyPI eero-client package offers the cleanest standalone experience. The **Home Assistant integration** remains the most complete reference implementation—its source code documents API endpoints that no other library exposes, making it invaluable for developers building comprehensive Eero control applications.
